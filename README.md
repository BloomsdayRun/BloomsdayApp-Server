Here is some initial work on a node.js webserver for the Bloomsday application. Although I think we'll end up using AWS for the app, it would be nice to have a server for the ENSC to test their GPS chip.

Usage: Ensure you have node.js installed, then run node <FILE>.js to start the server. Then point your web browser to localhost:8080 for the basic webserver, or localhost:8080/hi.txt for the static file server.
